# what-r-u-doing
"what-r-u-doing" is a fun way to make accountability fun. I was initially going to name the repository the name "accountability" but I would prefer to not make it so serious! This will be fun and meaningful (deep) for me. The point is to kickstart on my "career development" (ðŸ¤®) because I just finished school and I want to focus my energy on this!
