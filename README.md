# what-r-u-doing
"what-r-u-doing" is a fun way to make accountability fun. I was initially going to name the repository the name "accountability" but I would prefer to not make it so serious! This will be fun and meaningful (deep) for me. The point is to kickstart on my "career development" (ðŸ¤®) because I just finished school and I want to focus my energy on this!

A month has passed and I am excited to get back on this again. More recently, I've been practicing to be self-compassionate toward myself because I make so many mistakes. I realize that I am not perfect and my habit of being critical of myself is quite strong. I now know that I have to move through this process in a way that is most helpful to me.

# description
If I were to describe my life so far, I would say unconventional and probably interesting. Interesting! Most definitely. 
The purpose of this is to make the process of creating projects and applying for jobs easier for me, because this is an issue for me: not knowing what I want. I have a sense of what I want: to get a job that's challenging (intellectually stimulating) and move to one of the big cities. I think it's okay for me to have this goal, and invest time into this, even if I feel a little embarrassed.

I enjoy writing a lot too and speaking my thoughts out loud, so I thought this would be helpful for me. 

# what do u want to do right now?
Right now, I have a few things I want to do:
- revamp my resume
- submit my resume to an internship I'm interested in!
- create a website mimicking WNRS (We're not really strangers)
  - this is already a bit challenging for me because I will have to practice "beginner's mind" - I don't know anything!
  - what can I learn from this?
    - how to use git. how to code again. learning cs fundamentals. who knows what
    - what matters is that I really practice documentation. this is FUNDAMENTAL
    - i also want to do this daily, because it is important that I am consistent. I guess it's important that I don't have to be perfect, but ultimately, I want to be documenting this

Update (7:56pm, 9/29/2023):
Oh wow, it's been quite some time since I've logged on. I'm reading what I initially wrote and I am cringing a bit because:

1. It's been some time
2. I didn't touch my resume
3. I am not placing this as much of a priority, and I realize that maybe I have very high expectations of myself when it comes to this?

Anyway, I want to practice consistency and root for myself :)
