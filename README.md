# what-r-u-doing
"what-r-u-doing" is a fun way to make accountability fun. I was initially going to name the repository the name "accountability" but I would prefer to not make it so serious! This will be fun and meaningful (deep) for me. The point is to kickstart on my "career development" (ðŸ¤®) because I just finished school and I want to focus my energy on this!

A month has passed and I am excited to get back on this again. More recently, I've been practicing to be self-compassionate toward myself because I make so many mistakes. I realize that I am not perfect and my habit of being critical of myself is quite strong. I now know that I have to move through this process in a way that is most helpful to me.

# description
If I were to describe my life so far, I would say unconventional and probably interesting. Interesting! Most definitely. 
The purpose of this is to make the process of creating projects and applying for jobs easier for me, because this is an issue for me: not knowing what I want. I have a sense of what I want: to get a job that's challenging (intellectually stimulating) and move to one of the big cities. I think it's okay for me to have this goal, and invest time into this, even if I feel a little embarrassed.

I enjoy writing a lot too and speaking my thoughts out loud, so I thought this would be helpful for me. 

# what do u want to do right now?
Right now, I have a few things I want to do:
- revamp my resume
- submit my resume to an internship I'm interested in!
- create a website mimicking WNRS (We're not really strangers)
  - this is already a bit challenging for me because I will have to practice "beginner's mind" - I don't know anything!
  - what can I learn from this?
    - how to use git. how to code again. learning cs fundamentals. who knows what
    - what matters is that I really practice documentation. this is FUNDAMENTAL
    - i also want to do this daily, because it is important that I am consistent. I guess it's important that I don't have to be perfect, but ultimately, I want to be documenting this

Update (7:56pm, 9/29/2023):
Oh wow, it's been quite some time since I've logged on. I'm reading what I initially wrote and I am cringing a bit because:

1. It's been some time
2. I didn't touch my resume
3. I am not placing this as much of a priority, and I realize that maybe I have very high expectations of myself when it comes to this?

Anyway, I want to practice consistency and root for myself :)

Update (8:49pm, 10/19/2023):
Oh wow, it's been almost a month! Haha, this is embarrassing but I think... I'm okay with being not on time. What does time even mean?

I still didn't touch this part yet, although I don't feel as much resistance. I think it's pretty universal that no one likes change, and that change is very uncomfortable. I know there are a lot of areas in my life where I decided that change isn't necessary right now.

For example, I think about my romantic life. I am very okay with being single right now, especially since I'm putting more effort into doing things that matter to me, like reading, exercising, journaling, and spending more time with myself. I think my view on romantic relationships has changed significantly too, and it feels more healthy to me. Meaning that I don't place my worth on whether someone finds me attractive; I care that I find myself attractive regardless of how someone may view me. This shift is a little challenging because I know that it is important for me to have good relationships with others, and so I can easily say that I don't have a lot of experience in this area in my life. However, there isn't anything wrong with this, just different.

I can also just say that I haven't found anyone right too, and that it isn't so important.

What's most important to me is how I feel about myself and how I can push myself forward toward my goals and endeavors. 

Writing this, I see what's most important to me, and that the time I take to pause (hehe) is necessary for reflection. However! I want to shift my focus and attention onto what's important to me like seeing myself in a positive light, and that by doing my resume, and practicing to believe in myself is key to living a fulfilling life that's exciting for me. 

I finished university a couple of months ago, and it's a step toward independence. I can apply for jobs freely without having to worry about finishing my degree, because I am done. 

Yes, transitions are hard, but I have a lot of good things going well in my life right now, such as the friends I have in my life, my family, and the support that I have!

How beautiful this is, and I don't need a romantic partner to complete me. 

The fact that I can freely write this, and have 0 viewers see this is wonderful. I am practicing to open my thoughts because I have a habit of being private and not being known because sky_fierra-everything_is_embarrassing.mp3. Hahahaha.
